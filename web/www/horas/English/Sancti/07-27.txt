[Lectio93]
This Pantaleon was of a noble family of Nicomedia, and was a physician by trade.~
Hermolaus the Priest taught him well the faith of Jesus Christ, and he was~
baptized. A little while after, he persuaded his father Eustorgius to become a~
Christian. He afterwards duly preached the Faith of the Lord Christ at Nicomedia,~
and exhorted all to embrace His doctrine. For this he was tortured under the~
Emperor Diocletian, first on the rack, and then by putting red-hot metal to his~
body. He bore all the bitterness of his torments with a quiet and brave heart,~
and at last received the stroke of the sword, and grasped the crown of~
martyrdom.
