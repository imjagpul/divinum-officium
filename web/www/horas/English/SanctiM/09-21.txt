"Verily one had four faces" four faces, that is, and one body. If thou seek to know what Matthew teacheth concerning the Incarnation of the Lord, he teacheth no other doctrine than teacheth Mark, or Luke, or John. If thou seek to know what John teacheth, it is beyond all doubt that his doctrine is the doctrine of Matthew, and Mark, and Luke. If thou ask concerning Mark, he hath that which hath Matthew, and John, and Luke. If thou wilt know of Luke, know that he teacheth as doth Matthew, and Mark, and John.

Continuation ++ of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 9:9-13
At that time, Jesus saw a man named Matthew sitting in the tax-collector’s place,~
and said to him, Follow Me. And he arose and followed Him. And it came to pass~
as He was at table in the house, that, behold, many publicans and sinners came~
to the table with Jesus and His disciples. And the Pharisees seeing it, said to~
His disciples, Why does your Master eat with publicans and sinners? But Jesus~
heard it, and said, It is not the healthy who need a physician, but they who are~
sick. But go, and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.’~
For I have come to call sinners, not the just.
