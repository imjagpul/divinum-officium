Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 4:18-22
At that time, as Jesus was walking by the sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers,~
Simon, who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the sea~
- for they were fishermen -. And He said to them, Come, follow Me, and I will make~
you fishers of men. And at once they left the nets, and followed Him. And going~
farther on, He saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and his brother~
John, in a boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and He called~
them. And immediately they left their nets and their father, and followed him.
