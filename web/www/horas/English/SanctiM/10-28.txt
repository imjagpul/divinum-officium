Continuation ++ of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 15:17-25
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples, These things I command you, that you~
may love one another. If the world hates you, know that it has hated Me before~
you. If you were of the world, the world would love what is its own. But because~
you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the~
world hates you. Remember the word that I have spoken to you: No servant is~
greater than his master. If they persecuted Me, they will persecute you also; if~
they have kept My word, they will keep yours also. But all these things they~
will do to you for My name’s sake, because they do not know Him Who sent me. If I~
had not come and spoken to them, they would have no sin. But now they have no~
excuse for their sin. He who hates Me hates My Father also. If I had not done~
among them works such as no one else has done, they would have no sin. But now~
they have seen, and have hated both Me and My Father; but that the word written~
in their Law may be fulfilled, ‘They have hated Me without cause.’
