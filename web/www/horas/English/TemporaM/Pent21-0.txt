Continuation ++ of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 18:23-35
At that time, Jesus spoke to His disciples this parable: The kingdom of heaven~
is likened to a king who desired to settle accounts with his servants. And when~
he had begun the settlement, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand~
talents. And as he had no means of paying, his master ordered him to be sold,~
with his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made. But the~
servant fell down and besought him, saying, ‘Have patience with me and I will~
pay you all!’ And moved with compassion, the master of that servant released him,~
and forgave him the debt. But as that servant went out, he met one of his~
fellow-servants who owed him a hundred denarii and he laid hold of him, and~
throttled him, saying, ‘Pay what you owe.’ His fellow-servant therefore fell~
down and began to entreat him, saying, ‘Have patience with me and I will pay you~
all.’ But he would not; but went away and cast him into prison until he should~
pay what was due. His fellow-servants therefore, seeing what had happened, were~
very much saddened, and they went and informed their master of what had taken~
place. Then his master called him, and said to him, ‘Wicked servant! I forgave~
you all the debt, because you entreated me. Should not you also have had pity on~
your fellow-servant, even as I had pity on you?’ And his master, being angry,~
handed him over to the torturers until he should pay all that was due to him. So~
also My heavenly Father will do to you, if you do not each forgive your brothers~
from your hearts.
