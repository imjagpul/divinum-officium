Continuation ++ of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 22:15-21
At that time, the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might trap Jesus in~
His talk. And they sent to Him their disciples with the Herodians, saying,~
Master, we know that You are truthful, and that You teach the way of God in~
truth, and that You care naught for any man; for You do not regard the person of~
men. Tell us, therefore, what do You think: Is it lawful to give tribute to~
Caesar, or not? But Jesus, knowing their wickedness, said, Why do you test Me,~
you hypocrites? Show Me the coin of the tribute. So they offered Him a~
denarius. Then Jesus said to them, Whose are this image and the inscription?~
They said to Him, Caesar’s. Then He said to them, Render, therefore, to Caesar~
the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.
