Continuation ++ of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 22:1-14
 At that time, Jesus spoke to the chief priests and the Pharisees in parables,~
saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a king who made a marriage feast for his~
son. And he sent his servants to call in those invited to the marriage feast,~
but they would not come. Again he sent out other servants, saying, "Tell those~
who are invited, behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fatlings are~
killed, and everything is ready; come to the marriage feast." But they made~
light of it, and went off, one to his farm, and another to his business; and the~
rest laid hold of his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them. But~
when the king heard of it, he was angry; and he sent his armies, destroyed those~
murderers, and burnt their city. Then he said to his servants, "The marriage~
feast indeed is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy; go therefore~
to the crossroads, and invite to the marriage feast whomever you shall find."~
And his servants went out into the roads, and gathered all whom they found, both~
good and bad; and the marriage feast was filled with guests. Now the king went~
in to see the guests, and he saw there a man who had not on a wedding garment.~
And he said to him, "Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding~
garment?" But he was speechless. Then the king said to the attendants, "Bind his~
hands and feet and cast him forth into the darkness outside, where there will be~
the weeping and the gnashing of teeth." For many are called, but few are chosen.
