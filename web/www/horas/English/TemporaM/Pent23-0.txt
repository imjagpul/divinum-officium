[Lectio12]
"For she said within herself: If I shall touch the hem of his garment I shall be healed." According to the Law anyone who touched a woman having an issue of blood became unclean; this woman therefore touched the Lord that she might be cured of her issue of blood. "Be of good heart, daughter, your faith hath made you whole." He did not say, "Your faith shall make you whole," but rather, "Your faith hath made three whole." For, because you believed in him, you are already whole.

Continuation ++ of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 9:18-26
At that time, as Jesus was speaking to the crowds, behold, a ruler came up and~
worshipped Him, saying, "Lord, my daughter has just now died; but come and lay~
Your hand upon her, and she will return to life." And Jesus arose and followed~
him, and so did His disciples. Now a woman who for twelve years had been~
suffering from hemorrhage, came up behind him and touched the tassel of His~
cloak saying to herself, "If I touch but His cloak I shall be saved." But Jesus,~
turning and seeing her, said, "Take courage, daughter; your faith has saved~
you." And the woman was restored to health from that moment. And when Jesus came~
to the ruler's house, and saw the flute players and the crowd making a din, He~
said, "Begone, the girl is asleep, not dead." And they laughed Him to scorn. But~
when the crowd had been put out, He went in and took her by the hand; and the~
girl arose. And the report of this spread throughout all that district.
