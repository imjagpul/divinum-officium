In that same Gospel of St Matthew we read: Behold my Son whom I have chosen; my elect in whom my soul is well pleased; I shall place my Spirit over him and he will mete out judgment to the Gentiles. This is to be understood of the Saviour, on whom the Spirit of the Lord rested, that is, remained eternally.

[Responsory8]
R. Behold, the Lord shall come, and all His saints with Him, then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped, then shall the lame man leap as a hart,
* And the tongue of the dumb shall be free.
V. Behold, the Lord shall come with might, and His arm shall rule.
R. And the tongue of the dumb shall be free.

Continuation ++ of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt. 11:2-10
At that time, when John had heard in prison of the works of Christ, he sent two~
of his disciples to say to Him, Are You He Who is to come, or shall we look for~
another? And Jesus answering said to them, Go and report to John what you have~
heard and seen: the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf~
hear, the dead rise, the poor have the gospel preached to them. And blessed is~
he who is not scandalized in Me. Then, as they went away, Jesus began to say to~
the crowds concerning John, What did you go out to the desert to see? A reed~
shaken by the wind? But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft~
garments? Behold, those who wear soft garments are in the houses of kings. But~
what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.~
This is he of whom it is written, ‘Behold, I send my messenger before Your face,~
who shall make ready Your way before You.’
