Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt. 24:15-35
At that time, Jesus said to His disciples: When you see the abomination of~
desolation, which was spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy~
place - let him who reads understand - then let those who are in Judea flee to~
the mountains; and let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything~
from his house; and let him who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak.~
But woe to those who are with child, or have infants at the breast in those~
days! But pray that your flight may not be in the winter, or on the Sabbath. For~
then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of~
the world until now, nor will be. And unless those days had been shortened, no~
living creature would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be~
shortened. Then if anyone say to you, ‘Behold, here is the Christ,’ or ‘There He~
is,’ do not believe it. For false christs and false prophets will arise, and~
will show great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the~
elect. Behold, I have told it to you beforehand. If therefore they say to you,~
‘Behold, He is in the desert,’ do not go forth; ‘Behold, He is in the inner~
chambers,’ do not believe it. For as the lightning comes forth from the east and~
shines even to the west, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. Wherever~
the body is, there will the eagles be gathered together. But immediately after~
the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not~
give her light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven~
will be shaken. And then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven; and~
then will all tribes of the earth mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming~
upon the clouds of heaven with great power and majesty. And He will send forth~
His angels with a trumpet and a great sound, and they will gather His elect from~
the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other. Now from the fig tree~
learn this parable. When its branch is now tender, and the leaves break forth,~
you know that summer is near. Even so, when you see all these things, know that~
it is near, even at the door. Amen I say to you, this generation will not pass~
away till all these things have been accomplished. Heaven and earth will pass~
away, but my words will not pass away.
