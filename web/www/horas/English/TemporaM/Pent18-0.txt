Continuation ++ of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 9:1-8
At that time, Jesus, getting into a boat, crossed over and came to his own town.~
And behold, they brought to Him a paralytic lying on a pallet. And Jesus, seeing~
their faith, said to the paralytic, Take courage, son; your sins are forgiven~
you. And behold, some of the scribes said within themselves, This man~
blasphemes. And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, Why do you harbor evil~
thoughts in your hearts? For which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven~
you,’ or to say, ‘Arise, and walk’? But that you may know that the Son of Man~
has power on earth to forgive sins, - then He said to the paralytic - Arise,~
take up your pallet and go to your house. And he arose, and went away to his~
house. But when the crowds saw it, they were struck with fear, and glorified God~
Who had given such power to men.
