Continuation ++ of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 1:19-28
At that time, the Jews sent to John from Jerusalem priests and Levites to ask~
him, Who are you? And he acknowledged and did not deny; and he acknowledged, I~
am not the Christ. And they asked him, What then? Are you Elias? And he said, I~
am not. Are you the Prophet? And he answered, No. They therefore said to him,~
Who are you? that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What have you to~
say of yourself? He said, I am the voice of one crying in the desert, ‘Make~
straight the way of the Lord,’ as said Isaias the prophet. And they who had been~
sent were from among the Pharisees. And they asked him, and said to him, Why,~
then, do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elias, nor the Prophet?~
John said to them in answer, I baptize with water; but in the midst of you there~
has stood One Whom you do not know. He it is Who is to come after me, Who has~
been set above me, the strap of Whose sandal I am not worthy to loose. These~
things took place at Bethany, beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
