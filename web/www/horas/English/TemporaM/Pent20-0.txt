Continuation ++ of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 4:46-53
At that time, there was a certain royal official whose son was lying sick at~
Capharnaum. When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, he went~
to Him and besought Him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point~
of death. Jesus therefore said to him, Unless you see signs and wonders, you do~
not believe. The royal official said to Him, Sir, come down before my child~
dies. Jesus said to him, Go your way, your son lives. The man believed the word~
that Jesus spoke to him, and departed. But even as he was now going down, his~
servants met him and brought word saying that his son lived. He asked of them~
therefore the hour in which he had got better. And they told him, Yesterday, at~
the seventh hour, the fever left him. The father knew then that it was at that~
very hour in which Jesus had said to him, Your son lives. And he himself~
believed, and his whole household.
