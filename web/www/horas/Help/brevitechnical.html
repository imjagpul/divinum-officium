This part of the help manual is written explicitly for encouraging anyone interested
in the topic to write his/her own system, using whatever he/she wants from these ideas. It is also meant to provide a general overview of how the programlet is internally structured.
The only restriction is that we at The Divinum Officium Project have no legal responsibility for any mistake, 
and the ideas cannot be copyrighted, limiting our rights or the access of others to the 
same ideas.</FONT><BR><BR>


<A NAME='databases'></A>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=#Top>Top</A></FONT></P>
<span class=prmm>Databases</span><BR><BR> 
The databases are files, which contain the text of the Breviary. 
For easier understanding and handling, they are organized into folders. Most files use UTF-8 encoding (which is preferred) but some files may still remain in Win-1252 encoding. If editing files, please be aware of this difference, as it can and will effect the appearance of text. If editing via GitHub in a browser, GitHub will automatically transcode files to UTF-8.<BR><BR>

The top level folders are folders for the languages (Latin, English, Magyar, etc.).
At this moment folders are filled up. The basic rule is that if a file is missing,
the program automatically selects from the English.<BR><BR>

Each language folder contains the same set of subfolders, which represents the parts of the
printed berviary volumes: Ordinarium, Psalterium, Tempora, Sancti, Commune. For technical reasons,
there are separate folders for the psalms, and for the Martyrologium.<BR><BR> 
The style and punctuation used within the text is that of the 1962 liturgical books. One space is used between sentences. In accordance with the principles sent to the typographers of the 1960 editiones typicae, the letter J in the 1960 rubrics is transformed to the letter I. (<I>Sacrae Congregatio Rituum, "Ordinationes ad librorum liturgicorum editores", 26.VI.1960</I>)<BR><BR>
The files itself usually are converted into <span class=prma>Hash elements.</span>
The <span class=prma>key</span> is enclosed into square brackets 
<span class=pram>[ ... ]</span> which is a separate line followed by the body of the element. For instance, [Ant 2] refers to the Benedictus antiphon at Lauds, while [Lectio93] normally refers to the 9th (hagiographical) reading of a commemorated saint (pre-1960), which became the 3rd reading at Matins on 3rd class feasts under 1960 rubrics.<BR><BR>
These elements are read and composed by the programlet. The folder and files can be 
viewed within the <a href='https://github.com/divinumofficium/divinum-officium'>GitHub</a> repository, which shows the files
in the following folders:<BR><BR>

<UL>
<LI><span class=prma>Ordinarium</span> folder is the collection of the scripts describing the canonical hours.
Each hour is represented by two or more files. These files are not converted into hash. A line starting with hashmark organizes the content. These files are used by
<span class=prma>special.pl</span> program file. If necessary, there are separate files for the 1960 (name ending with 'r') or Tridentine version (name ending with 't') or for Paschal time (name ending with 'p'.)<BR><BR>

<LI><span class=prma>Psalterium</span> folder holds the information usually printed
in the Ordinarium and Psalterium sections of the <I>Breviarium Romanum</I>. <span class=prma>Prayers.txt</span>)
contains the common prayers. The rest contains the Benedictions, Doxologies, Psalm 94 prepared
as the Invitatory; seasonal parts for Matins (Matutinum special), Lauds, and Vespers (Major special);
Minor hours (Minor special); antiphons and psalm sets (Psalmi Major|Matutinum|Minor); 
Marian antiphons, and special seasonal parts for Prime.
<BR><BR>
<LI><span class=prma>Transfer</span> folder has the <B>transfer year</B> files. The Tr=Transfer files have <PRE>
mm-nn=filename;; 
</PRE> lines, where 'filename' is the name of the office (from the Proprium de Tempore or Proprium Sanctorum) and the 
mm-nn is the date in the given year to which it is transfered. For the 1960 rules, there are permanent
and year to year rules. For example, the TR19602018.txt file has the appropriate transfers for the 1960 rubrics in 2018. It is an ongoing project to establish a perpetual calendar calculation algorithm which would take all anomalies into account. Please help.
<BR><BR>

<LI><span class=prma>psalms</span> folder holds the 150 psalms, and the 
<span class=prma>canticles</span> for <BR><BR>
  <UL>
  <LI>210-216 = Laudes 1 
  <LI>220-226 = Laudes 2
  <LI>231-234 = New Testament canticles	and the Quicumque
  </UL> <BR>

The verses are numbered by chapter:verse numbers, and anything in parentheses
is printed in small red font.<BR><BR>

<LI><span class=prma>Tempora</span> folder holds the offices from the 
<span class=prma>Proprium de Tempore</span> Each office has exactly one file, 
and each is hash collection<BR>
Naming convention is:<PRE>
Season name w-d
</PRE> where <I>w</I> is the week of the season, and <I>d</I> is the day of week. (Example: Pent04-2 represents Tuesday of the 4th week after Pentecost.)<BR><BR>

<LI><span class=prma>Sancti</span> is the same collection for the 
<span class=prma>Proprium Sanctorum</span><BR>
Naming convention is:<PRE>
mm-nn
</PRE> where <I>mm</I> is the month, <I>nn</I> is the day. (Example: 07-26 represents July 26, Feast of St. Anne.) For practical reasons, unlike in 
the Roman Breviary, the Chrismastide offices are set within the Sancti folder.
<BR><BR>

<LI><span class=prma>Commune</span> is the collection for 
<span class=prma>Commune sanctorum</span>. The name of the office is 
under the first key: <B>Name</B>. See <a href="#specialchars">below</a> for examples.<BR>
For practical reasons, the <B>Officium Sanctae Mariae Sabbato</B> is referenced by the programlet from its position among the Tempora files as C10.
<BR><BR>

<LI><span class=prma>Martyrologium</span> contains the files named as mm-nn for the
Martyrologium. Please note that the Martyrology at Prime is anticipated for the subsequent day. See <A HREF=credits.html>credits</A> for the sources.<BR>
</UL><BR>

<A NAME='programs'></A>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=#Top>Top</A></FONT></P>
<span class=prmm>Programs</span><BR><BR> 
The programs are written in Perl 5.6 and generate HTML.

<span class=prmm>Special characters</span><BR><BR>

Either the files in the Ordinarium, and the other files are using special characters
to help the formatting. Each of them, with the exception of the ~ tilde sign,
has to be set in the beginning of a line.<BR><BR>

<UL>
<LI><span class=prma># hashmark</span> in the files
of Ordinarium folder or generated represent a chapter label. <I>Special.pl</I> 
program interprets and expands or limits primarily these lines. Also, they
respresent the skeleton of the particular Hour.<BR><BR>

<LI><span class=prma>[ name ]</span> in a separate line is the key for a
hash element, as mentioned earlier.<BR><BR>

 <LI><span class=prma>$ dollar</span> sign as the first character of a line, followed 
 by a name, represent a prayer found in Psalterium/Prayers file. These are the candidates
 for Popup if <I>psalmi</I> option is called. Some invokes an internal subroutine.<BR><BR>

 <LI><span class=prma>&</span> sign calls an internal subroutine. If the subroutine 
 name starts with capital letter that is listed only in <I>all</I> mode, if it starts with 
 small letter, <I>psalmi</I> option will expand it.<BR><BR>

 <LI><span class=prma>!</span> An exclamation point (at the beginning of a line) will print the line with red font.<BR><BR>

 <LI><span class=prma>v. </span> prints the following first leter as Initiale, large red font.
 <BR><BR>

 <LI><span class=prma>r. </span> prints the following first letter as regular red font.<BR><BR>

 <LI><span class=prma>R.br  R. V. * Ant. Benedictio</span> These starting words are printed
 in regular red font.<BR><BR>

 <LI><span class=prma>double end of line</span> represents a cell end, the printout will set
 a border separator.<BR><BR>

 <LI><span class=prma>_ underscore</span> in itself in a line represents an empty line
 without separation.<BR><BR>

 <LI><span class=prma>~ tilde</span> at the end of the line represents contraction.
 Without it, the end of line character will be shown as &lt;BR&gt; in the html file.<BR><BR>

 <LI><span class=prma>( text )</span> in psalm folder will print the enclosed text 
 in small red font.<BR><BR>

 <LI><span class=prma>digits</span> or <span class=prma>digits:digits</span> at the beginning of
 the line in psalms and readings are interpreted as verse numbers, and printed in red.<BR><BR>

<span class=prmm>Exceptions</span><BR><BR>

Many of the files in Tempora or Sancti folders have an entry: <span class=prm>Rule</span>.
There are the exceptions from those rule built into the <span class=prma>Ordinarium</span>
